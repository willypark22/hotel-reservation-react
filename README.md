<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]()

A Beach Resort web application that lets users browse through different types of rooms available. Users can check the price, room size, capacity, breakfast, and see if they can bring their pets. The project was inspired by [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ). I put my own twist with it by developing the majority of the project with React Hooks and arrow functions.

I am currently having trouble uploading the project onto Netlify. Once I solve the problem, I will upload the live website link onto this repo.


### Built With

### Learn More About Each Room

Users can view images and descriptions of each room after clicking on a room. To save time, all the images are similar and the descriptions are created with Lorem Ipsum. The Info panel shows the room's price, size, capacity, and type of room. It will also say whether the room allows pets and if free breakfast is given.

### Filter the Rooms You Want

Users can use the filter to display the rooms they are looking for. You can filter through room type, guest capacity, room price, room size, breakfast, and pets.
